# Elevate_Labs_Task-3
# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship** offered by **Elevate Labs** in collaboration with the **Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India**.

In this task, I implemented and analyzed **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** using the **House Price Prediction Dataset**. The goal was to predict house prices based on various features and understand the working of linear regression models in supervised learning.

## 📌 Objective

- Understand and implement Linear Regression from scratch using Scikit-learn.
- Perform end-to-end data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- Interpret regression metrics like **MAE**, **MSE**, **RMSE**, and **R² score**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML model and evaluation metrics

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)
- **Target Variable**: `price`
- **Features**: `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`, `furnishingstatus`, etc.

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Import libraries and load dataset**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Check for null values
   - Understand feature types (categorical vs numerical)
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
4. **Train-Test Split** (80/20 ratio)
5. **Model Training** using `LinearRegression`
6. **Prediction and Evaluation**
   - Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score
7. **Visualization**:
   - Actual vs Predicted values

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MAE    | 970043.4039201637   |
| MSE    | 1754318687330.6633   |
| RMSE   | 1324506.9600914384   |
| R²     | 0.6529242642153185 |

_(Values will vary depending on the preprocessing and dataset split)_

## 📉 Sample Output Plot

- A scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted prices.
- Ideally, the points should align closely to the diagonal.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to build regression models using Scikit-learn.
- Importance of preprocessing: handling missing data and encoding.
- How to interpret regression evaluation metrics.
- Visualizing and interpreting results.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Feature scaling and engineering
- Cross-validation to reduce overfitting
- Try advanced models like Ridge, Lasso, or Random Forest Regressor
